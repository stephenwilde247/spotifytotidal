# Migrate Your Spotify Playlists to Tidal with Ease!

Are you looking to move your Spotify playlists over to Tidal without manually recreating them? Look no further! I've created a **Python** tool that takes the heavy lifting out of the process, making it fast and hassle-free.

---

## How It Works
1. **Export Your Spotify Playlists**:  
   Head over to [Exportify](https://exportify.net/) log in with Spotify and download your playlists as CSV files.

2. **Prepare Your Files**:  
   Create and place all your playlist CSV files into a folder named `allPlaylists`.

3. **Run the Software**:  
   - Clone or download the repository.
   - Install tidalapi - pip install tidalapi.
   - Start the software using Python3.  
   - Click the login link provided to authenticate.  
   - Sit back and watch as the tool starts adding your playlists to Tidal!

## ðŸ›  Features
- **99% Accurate**: While the tool uses Tidal's search to find songs, there may occasionally be a cover version or slight mismatch. However, the vast majority of songs (Approx 99%) will match perfectly. ðŸŽ§
- **Saves Time**: This software handles the bulk of the work for you, so you can focus on enjoying your music rather than managing it.
